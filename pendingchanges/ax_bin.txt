Improvements:
 - Added a --thread [n] argument to the vdb_ax binary.
 - Added cin/cout pipe support to the vdb_ax binary.
 - Changed the positional arguments for the vdb_ax binary in execute mode. All positional arguments are now input grids which allows vdb_ax to read multiple files. To output the result -o must be used.
